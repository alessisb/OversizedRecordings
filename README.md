# Find Oversize Recordings with Powershell

Find oversized recordings on the voicemail server and move them to the appropriate users U: drive. Then email the user to notify them they have an oversized recording and where they can find it.

This script was born out of the need to move voicemail recording files that were too large to email to an alternate location and notify the user who created the large voicemail recording that they have a file waiting for them that could not be emailed.
